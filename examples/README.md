# Examples

This folder contains example notebooks for a quick hands-on experience with HyPhAI models. The examples are organized as follows:

## Files and Notebooks

1. **data:** The data sample used in the examples.
   
2. **full_dl_model_forecast_example.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook with the U-Net model used for comparison. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/relmonta/hyphai/blob/master/examples/full_dl_model_forecast_example.ipynb)

3. **hyphai:** Shortcut to the HyphAI package.

4. **hyphai-1_forecast_example.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook providing an example of forecasting using HyphAI-1 (advection). [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/relmonta/hyphai/blob/master/examples/hyphai-1_forecast_example.ipynb)

5. **hyphai-2_forecast_example.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook demonstrating another example of forecasting using HyphAI-2 (advection + source term). [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/relmonta/hyphai/blob/master/examples/hyphai-2_forecast_example.ipynb)

6. **outputs:** This directory contains the output files generated by the example notebooks.

7. **README.md:** You are currently reading this file!.

8. **weights:** This directory stores the pre-trained weights of the models used in the examples. The *.pt files contain the weights of the pre-trained models and not the entire models.

## Getting Started

You can run the example notebooks in the cloud using Google Colab or locally on your machine.

### Run in Google Colab

A link to the Google Colab notebook is provided at the top of each example notebook. You can also access the notebooks directly from the links above.

### Run in Local Machine
To run these examples locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/relmonta/hyphai.git
   cd hyphai
   ```

2. It is possible to install the HyphAI package in the virtual environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   cd src
   pip install -e .
   ```
   but this is not necessary to run the examples.

3. Navigate to the "examples" folder:

   ```bash
   cd examples # from the root directory of the repository
   ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies are installed. If not, install them using `pip` or `conda`.

## Note

- The `hyphai` shortcut is provided to make it easier to import the HyphAI package in the example notebooks without having to install it in the virtual environment.
